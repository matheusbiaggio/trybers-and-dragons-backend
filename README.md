## ðŸ“’ Introduction

In this project, the goal was to apply the principles of SOLID architecture and object-oriented programming principles to a role-playing game (RPG) framework, implementing a back-end for a game. The main idea is to create a system capable of creating a character or an environment creature.

In addition to character creation, it is possible for the character to choose a race from the following options:

  - Dwarf;
  - Elf;
  - Halfling;
  - Orc.

Each of these races has specific characteristics.

After creating their race, the player can choose their class within the game, which are also divided into 4 categories:

  - Mage;
  - Necromancer;
  - Warrior;
  - Ranger.

Each of these classes has different characteristics as well.

In addition to character creation, battles were also implemented, both player versus player (PVP) and player versus environment (PVE).
